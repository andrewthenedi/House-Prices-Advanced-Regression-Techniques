# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

If a person asks a home buyer to describe their ideal home, they are unlikely to start with the basement 
ceiling height or the closeness to an east-west railroad. However, the dataset from this project 
demonstrates that there are many more factors that impact price negotiations than 
the amount of beds or a white-picket fence. This project forecasts the ultimate price 
of each property using 79 explanatory factors that describe (nearly) every element of residential 
dwellings in Ames, Iowa.

## Getting Started
